# Rainfall_Prediction
### Objective
Rainfall forecasting is very important because heavy and irregular rainfall can have many impacts like destruction of crops and farms, damage of property so a better forecasting model is essential for an early warning that can minimize risks to life and property and also managing the agricultural farms in better way. This prediction mainly helps farmers and also water resources can be utilized efficiently. Rainfall prediction is a challenging task and the results should be accurate.
